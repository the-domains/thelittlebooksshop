The Balangay or Butuan Boat has been the symbol and logo of the Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival throughout the years. The colors red, blue and yellow equally dominate as it casts its travels among the waters of the bay. The Balangay boards the juries for this year's film festival, main completion jury: Padmashri Dr. Girish Kasaravalli and NETPAC juries: Ismail Basbeth andTsengel Davaasambuu, to let them experience the Balangay's cruise.
