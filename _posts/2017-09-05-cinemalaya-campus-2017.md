The Philippines had faced various issues from the past and had always been recurrently previewed through films and documentaries. These major problems, such as corruption and poverty, are common among them. As everything changes throughout time, these issues changes as well either for the better or for worse as more relevant problems sprout from its roots. Filmmakers, as part of the media industry with all these changes, have this responsibility as an instrument in the real portrayal of the Philippine society's major issues and possibly their solutions

This year's Cinemalaya Campus focused on films and filmmakers that featured the new shortcomings regarding this agenda.

Furthermore, Cinemalaya Campus magnifies the true essence or meaning that should be presented through this form of media, which is filmmaking.

The goal of Cinemalaya Campus is to reach out to the youth , who are the future filmmakers, as well as to educate them to become creative and responsible filmmakers.

The Cinemlaya Campus 2017 was held at the Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino (CCP Little Theater) last August 8-9, 2017\. Students & professors from Senior High School to College participated in the event. Some of the schools and/or universities who were present in taking part as the future's responsible and creative filmmakers are: De La Salle Benilde, De La Salle University Manila, St. Scholastica, Asia Pacific College even Senior High Schools from Kidapawan, North Cotabato, Batangas, Baguio, and Angono, Rizal.

Ms. Flordeliza Abanto started and moderated the whole event from its first day to its last. She had been hosting Cinemalaya Campus since 2014\. She was then followed by the Keynote Presentation of Mr. Clodualdo Del Mundo, Jr., the 2017 Cinemalaya Campus Co-director. He discussed the incorporation of a camera to a gun through its parts and terminologies. But then again, he explained that the camera is an anti-thesis of a gun in terms that a gun destroys while the camera on the contrary, creates.

**1st day**

**Session 1: **Beyond the Story: What does the screenplay mean?

The Cinemalaya Campus first session started with a short preview from Mr. Ricky Lee's short clips from his previous works such as: Lucia, Carnal and Himala. Mr. Lee shared his thoughts and experiences, then after, about his scriptwriting career.

According to him, some of his works are based from his previous experiences during the Marcos regime.

For him, it is good to write based from personal experiences but on the other hand, Mr. Lee explains, "Hindi laging personal na experience \[on writing\] kundi kung ano ang dapat paniwalaan."

The scriptwriting discussion continued as Mr. Adolfo Alix Jr. followed after Mr. Lee. He discussed the importance on knowing the story by being submerged with the people sharing the same story. He also shared that constraints are ways to produce an individual's creative juice on writing.

**Session 2: **From Low Key to High Key: Shedding light on the moving image

Lighting is an important role on expressing the director's idea into life through its creative form on each shot. Mr. Dix Buhay talked about the role of Low Key and High Key lights wherein Low Key Lighting is used for moody & dramatic scenes with the effective use of shadow & dark tones. High key lighting on the other hand, are for scenes that expresses optimism, beauty and lifestyle with the use of flat, bright & clean tones. He then added that the use of the key lighting does not literally only intends for that purpose but must really depict the scene's real intention even to deception of what is happening.

Mr. Jay Abello, one of the industry's best cinematographer, then talked about the real importance of a DOP not only to the technical side of the production but also to getting to know what the director wants to portray. For him, it is important to understand the director by knowing where he/she is during the certain time, especially when he is working with a new one.

**Session 3: **Character, color, design and meaning

Another important aspect for a film production in expressing the true meaning of a film is the production design. For this session, the Cinemalaya Campus had invited two renowned local artists who were experts in doing this field.

Mr. Leeroy New explained that it is good to know the economy of design to effectively & efficiently express the whole interpretation of the environment of the film.

Mr. Toym Imao emphasized to stick to the director's idea and thoughts in producing a wonderful set. He even shared a way to get ideas on when the time comes that he gets stuck on getting one. It is by doing a "Serendipity walk" where as for him, an artist must relax and submerge his self by knowing the people around.

**Session 4**: Scoring meaning with music and sound

The visual content would not be complete and effective in depicting the true meaning of film without its sound design. With that given, the Campus introduced its first female speaker for the whole event which is Ms. Corrine De San Jose. She presented the 4 pointer that she usually use on doing her sound design: Mood or feel; The Sound Effects; Avoiding Sound Clichés & Oral Motifs.

The first session for the second day talked about the importance of editing a film on how this process helps in defining the film's meaning. The first two guest speakers for this day were the scriptwriters of the film "Apocalypse Child" Mr. Mario Cornejo and Ms. Monster Jimenez, who also happened to be the editor of the said film explained the power of editing in making or manipulating the time of a film.

According to Mr. Cornejo, he is very much into film because of this creative power to express a story. "You can play with time that only films can do."

Ms. Tara Illenberg, another highly-acclaimed film editor discussed further the power of this process. She emphasized that the film is all the combined art forms, which incorporates Theater, Music and even Visual Arts.

According to Ms. Illenberg, "If film is a language, editing is its grammar." She even enumerates what a good editor must understand: The genre; the director's vision; the context; the plot & story in the script; the character's profiles; the scene motivation and good editing & emotion.

**Session 6: **Mise-en-scéne and Meaning
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f1b06860-bc64-4f7b-9ac0-de3fac780f45.jpg)

For this session, Mr. Carlos Siguion-Reyna talked about the few aspects of mise-en-scéne which means "having been put into the scene." For him, it is important to reread the script and breakdown the scenes to fully understand the whole point of the film.

Mise-en-scéne is also important because the blocking of every element in a shot is not in the script.

Mr. Teng Mangansalan followed up the discussion with the proper use of signs in expressing a shot's true meaning.

For his works, he often use bizarre framing and incorporation of objects, such as mirrors, to portray another meaning.

**Session 7: **Ano sa tingin mo? Reaching the spectator.

For the final session of the campus, a group of award-winning filmmakers, producers, professor, film analyst and actor were invited to share their thoughts and experiences on how to reach spectators.

Ms. Bliss Lim, an Associate Professor, leads the discussion through analyzing the film Zombadings: Patayin sa shokot si Remington (Remington and the curse of the Zombadings) on how it had affected and made arguments and discussion with the LGBT community. This film is a good example on how to make spectators from a specific target market reacts to the film's hidden value.

Mr. Richard Bolisay, a film critic, intricated his discussion with the truth about money-making in the film industry where he explained that there will always be an artistic perspective & a business perspective in it. For him, it is also important to know and show the explicit and implicit meaning of a film.

Ms. Baby Ruth, a producer and filmmaker of documentary films, then talked about finding your purpose with the use of IKIGAI model. She explains that every time that she gets lost in her work or in a certain point in time, she looks back on this model and remembers her reason why she is doing this.

For her, it is important to nurture the audience which can be done through its promotions and marketing.

Last to share her thoughts is an indie actor, Mrs. Angeli Bayani. She explained that actors are also important element on film production in rendering its real meaning. It is important for her to portray what the director wants to visualize to the audience. She added that they are only instruments, that the real meaning of a film is not about them but is about the story of a film. She even quoted a statement from Herbie Go, "There is no such thing as a bad audience, only bad actors."

After the two-day sessions of the 2017 Cinemalaya Campus, we dare say that the young and eager attendees are now equipped with the much needed key insights from the speakers on how to be responsible and creative filmmakers. Ideas and thoughts on creating a good story may take some time, but who knows, some of them will probably be great filmmakers someday.

The Cinemalaya Campus 2017 has indeed served its purpose in reaching out and nurturing the filmmakers of the future.
