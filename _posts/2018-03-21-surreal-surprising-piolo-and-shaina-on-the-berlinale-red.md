  If you ask actors Shaina Magdayao and Piolo Pascual, collaborating with Lav
  Diaz in the martial law musical, "Ang Panahon ng Halimaw," was a
  career-defining experience. Especially for Shaina, who is a self-described
  "Lav newbie." "It was definitely surreal to have had the chance to finally
  work with the Lav Diaz," Shaina told the Inquirer.
